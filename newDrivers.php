          <h1>  New &amp; Young Drivers</h1>
      A few years ago legislation was passed to make it automatic that a &quot;New Driver&quot; who got up to six points within the first two years of having passed a driving test would automatically go back to square one and have to re-take the entire driving test.
<br/><br/>
This can cause great difficulties for new or recently qualified drivers who rely upon their driving licences for work.
<br/><br/>
We have persuaded courts throughout the country to take a particular course of action when faced with one of these situations which is the only way to avoid going back to square one.
<br/><br/>
If you are a &quot;New Driver&quot; and are likely to get up to six points you must contact us immediately.
<br/><br/>
If you already have three points and receive the offer of a fixed penalty you must not accept the fixed penalty as this would automatically lead to you going back to square one.
<br/><br/>
The rules are so severe that you must â€“ CALL US STRAIGHT AWAY
