          <h1>    Pedestrian Crossing (failing to accord precedence)</h1>
   It is an offence for a driver of any vehicle to fail to accord precedence to a pedestrian within the limits of an uncontrolled pedestrian crossing.
  <br/>  <br/>
  The penalties include; a fine of £1000.00, a disqualification for any period/ until a test is past. Must endorse unless special reasons can be found to avoid endorsement. 3 points and £60.00 fixed penalty.
    <br/>  <br/>
  The law imposes a very strict duty on the driver. A realistic defence would have to amount to circumstances beyond the control of the driver. Not the offence  can be committed by a cyclist.
    <br/>  <br/>
  Note that the limits of the crossing are marked by studs which are adjacent to the striped lines. The broken white line along the crossing is to indicate where vehicles should stop.
    <br/>  <br/>
  Note similar provisions apply to Pelican Crossings.
