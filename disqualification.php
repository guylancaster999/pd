       <h1>Disqualification</h1>
        Disqualification is an order of the court and driving whilst disqualified is considered very seriously by the courts.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Normally the minimum sentence for driving while you are disqualified is a community sentence although many courts will wish to sentence you to prison.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Disqualification can either be mandatory or discretionary.
        Disqualification can also be imposed by virtue of the “totting up” provisions.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        A disqualification can have far reaching effects often costing you your job, business etc.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Subject to certain time periods an application can be made for the removal of a disqualification before its normal end.
        <span class="mainGreen">We are very experienced in these applications and have succeeded in virtually all of the cases we have taken.</span>
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Even in a case where there is a mandatory disqualification, for example drink driving, the court can be persuaded to avoid imposing a disqualification if they can be convinced that Special Reasons exist.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Special Reasons could include shortness of distance driven, driving because of medical emergency, laced drinks.   <br/>
