          <h1>       No Tax - Road Fund ( Excise License)</h1>

          It is an offence to use or keep on a public road a mechanically propelled vehicle when no excise license is in force.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          The penalties include a fine of £1000, £2500, or 5 times the value of the vehicle, which ever is the greater.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          The charge includes not only the use but the driver's mere presence of the car on the road.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          It is a defence of the vehicle was used by another who used it without the authority of the owner.
          The use of a vehicle by an employee can be arguably a defence as to prosecute would amount to oppression.
          <br/>
