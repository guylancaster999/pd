          <h1>Dangerous Driving</h1>
          This is a serious offence and you should not think about facing this charge alone. There is a risk that the court will decline jurisdiction and send the case to the Crown Court for trial before a judge and jury.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          The legal definition is a 2 stage process; Did the driving fall below that of a careful competent driver, and it would be obvious to a competent and careful driver that driving in that way would be dangerous.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          If you were convicted of this offence, you face a minimum one year ban, extended re test before the return of your license, and the threat of a custodial sentence of up to 2 years.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          However we are here to help. There are many cases where when the facts are analysed carefully and correct representations made. The CPS can reconsider the true gravity of the case and consider if the correct charge has been brought.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          The court will look at all the features of the offence, we would look to find factors that would include a ‘one off’ piece of poor driving, a silly error of judgement, a good driving record, good character generally, and other mitigating features.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          We will provide objective practical advice and assistance, and understanding counsel.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          Do not face this offence alone, contact us immediately.   <br/>
