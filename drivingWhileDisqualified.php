          <h1>Driving While Disqualified</h1>
          The imposition of a driving disqualification is regarded by the court as a serious matter.
           Driving whilst disqualified will often lead to a custodial sentence.
           It is occasionally possible to persuade the court to remove a disqualification part-way through.
           We can advise you as to the making of an application to remove a disqualification and represent you at the court hearing.
