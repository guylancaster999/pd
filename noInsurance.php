                 <h1>Driving Without Insurance</h1>
			Using a motor vehicle on a road or other public place without a policy of insurance is a criminal offence which can attract a fine, 6-8 points, or a discretionary disqualification, including a retest.
           <br/>
           <br/>
			Mandatory disqualification unless special reasons exist.
           <br/>
           <br/>
			If you are charged with this offence it is for you to establish that you have a policy of insurance.
           <br/>
           <br/>
			There is a statutory defence available to employed drivers if certain criteria are met.
           <br/>
           <br/>
			The courts treat these cases very seriously, imposing severe fines and often looking to disqualify, expert mitigation is necessary to reduce the likely sentence.
           <br/>
           <br/>
			We will provide objective practical advice and assistance, and understanding counsel.
           <br/>

			Do not face this offence alone, contact us immediately.
