			Note these are the maximum sentencing powers available to the court.
			Our job is to secure the most lenient sentence for our clients and to ensure that the court are able to distinguish our clients position from other defendants before the court, and to exercise leniency in our favour. This is done by careful preparation of the case , character witnesses,  references,  meticulous attention to detail,  and the instruction of experienced counsel.
			<br><br>
			Note: Generally possession or supply of class A drugs should go to the crown court, unless the offence is possession and the amount is small and consistent with personal use.
			<br><br>
			Supply of Class B drugs should go to the crown court unless the supply was of small scale and not for payment.
			<br><br>
			Generally the courts will punish cases of supplying drugs very heavily our job is to take the court from the legislation language and guidelines of the 1971 legislation and to explain the situation that exists today for those who are charged with these offences. 
			To engage the court with evidence of the current social climate surrounding drug use the pressures from those higher up the chain of supply and to explain the consequences of imprisonment on the individual.
			<br><br>
			We know how easily people can be caught up in a world outside their experience and control and will persuade the court to take all these factors into account.
