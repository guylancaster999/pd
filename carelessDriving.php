         The penalty for this offence is 3-9 penalty points, a possible disqualification and a fine.
		  <br/>
		  <br/>
			These are all very harsh penalties for an offence which most drivers are capable of committing.
      The Legal definition of the charge is where your driving falls below the standard expected of a careful competent driver.
			  <br/>
			  <br/>
			This offence can be committed in a public place and a road, so includes supermarket car parks and the like.
			  <br/>
			  <br/>
			A skid may not be due to lack of care, a sudden emergency should be judged in the course of the driving.
      A mechanical defect of the vehicle can provide a defence provided the driver had no prior knowledge of it's existence.

			We will provide objective practical advice and assistance, and understanding counsel.
